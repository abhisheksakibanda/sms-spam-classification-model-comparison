# A Comparison of Models for SMS Spam Classification

We compared the performance of different models for SMS spam classification. The models we used are:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Stochastic Gradient Descent

We used the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) from Kaggle.
The dataset contains 5574 SMS messages.
We used 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

Please find the code for the Custom implementation of Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier [here](SMSSpamClassification-CustomImplementation.ipynb).

Please find the code for the Scikit-learn implementations of the four mentioned models [here](SMSSpamClassficiation-PreTrained.ipynb).
